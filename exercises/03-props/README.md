## Assignment 1

The component should accept a prop "name", which accepts a string.
If "name" is provided, the component should render "Hello **\_\_\_\_\_**"

If "name" is not provided to the component, the component should render "Hello user."

To achieve this, please use default props.

## Assignment 1

Create a component called `<Welcome />`. It should receive the prop "name". If "name" is provided, you will render "Hello **\_\_\_\_\_**". If the name is not provided, you will fallback to "Hello user".

Import and your render you `<Welcome />` component in `<App />` like this:

```jsx
<Welcome name="Jamal" />
<Welcome />
```

### Acceptance Criteria

- I should create a component called `<Welcome />` that should render test to the screen.
- It should receive the prop "name".
- It should use default props.
- If "name" is provided, you will render "Hello **\_\_\_\_\_**". If the name is not provided, you will fallback to "Hello user".

## Assignment 2

Import and your render you `<Welcome />` component in `<App />` like this:

```jsx
<Heading>Welcome to my React App!</Heading>
```

### Acceptance Criteria

- I should create a component called `<Heading />` that renders children props to the screen.
- The `<App />` component should use the `<Heading />` component to render the text "Welcome to my React App!" to the screen.
